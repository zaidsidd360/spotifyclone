<h1>Spotify landing page UI</h1>
<p>This was my first ever solo project after finishing the basics of frontend web developement. Although I Googled a few things here and there, I learned and wrote a ton of CSS on my own, including flexbox and media queries for designing a responsive layout. I am finally confident enough in my CSS abilities to create designs withount needing libraries like Bootstrap (two thumbs down btw, I hate bootstrap), or tailwind. This project also helped me learn a lot about HTML semantics and the basics of JavaScript DOM manipulation.</p>
