# Spotify landing page clone
Landing page UI for Spotify, made with HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. I made sure to not use any frameworks or libraries for this one as it was meant to help me learn HTML semantics and CSS from the ground up. I learned and wrote a ton of CSS, including flexbox and media queries for designing a responsive layout.

Areas of focus: media queries, dom manipulation, semantic HTML, pure CSS, javascript.
